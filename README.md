# Gifted 4 Eternity – Creative Media Repository

## Project Overview

This repository powers the **Gifted 4 Eternity** creative platform — a dual-purpose digital storefront and content hub that brings together **children’s educational books** and **original music** under one mission-driven brand.

The project is designed to support:

* Independent art and storytelling
* Faith-informed, life-experience-driven content
* Affordable access to music and learning resources

It is built as a static website (GitHub Pages–ready) with room to grow into a full-featured digital marketplace.
